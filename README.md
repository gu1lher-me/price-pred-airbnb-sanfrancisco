# price-pred-airbnb-data
Price prediction project using data from the public Airbnb San Francisco dataset. The project consists of a data preparation phase, an exploratory data analysis with geospacial insights and the construction of two regression models for comparison, an OLS linear regression using the scikit-learn module and a XGBoost regression.

Such models could be turned into a product capable of estimating an optimal price range for new accommodations, thus aiding hosts in the process of deciding the price they will ask for.
